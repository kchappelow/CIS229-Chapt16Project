#Chapter 16 Project

Create an image animator with audio

Create animation shown in figure included in homework to meet the following requirements:

* Allow the user to specify the animation speed in a text field.
* Get the number of images and image's file-name prefix from the user. For example, if the user enters **n** for the number of images and **L** for the image prefix, the the files are **L1.gif, L2.gif**, and so on, to **L_n_.gif**. Assume that the images are stored in the **image** directory, a subdirectory of the program's class directory. The animation displays the images one after the other.
* Allow the user to specify an audio file URL. The audio is played with the animation runs.
		
##Tasks
* Code: Write a program to solve the problem.
* Are the images shown as an animation (slide show)?
* Is the audio playing?
* Submit your program and supporting files using git.
